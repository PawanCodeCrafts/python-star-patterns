## 📝 About Star Patterns

**Star patterns** are visual arrangements of asterisks (`*`) printed using code.  
They are a classic way to practice programming fundamentals such as loops, conditional statements, and nested structures.  
Typical patterns include squares, triangles, pyramids, diamonds, and more – each helping you understand how to control code flow and output formatting.
